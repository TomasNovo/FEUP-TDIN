## 1. Project 1 - ChaTime

For this project, we developed an Internet Relay Chat based on remote objects architectural style with .NET Remoting. Clients use an GUI where they can register/login and chat with other users. In the index interface, it's possible to see which users are only and which users are not. Client can stablish communications with one user or with several users. In the chat interface it's possible to send files, to change the colours of each user's messages, to change the chat name and to send files.
